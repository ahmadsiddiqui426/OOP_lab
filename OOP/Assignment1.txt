Question 1:
Write a program that defines a shape class with setters and getters that set and get the values to width and height variable. Then define two sub-classes triangle and rectangle, that calculate the area of these shapes area (). In the main, define two variables a triangle and a rectangle and then call the area() function in this two varibles.

Question 2:
Write a program that would print the information (name, year of joining, salary, address) of three employees by creating a class named 'Employee'. The output should be as follows:
Name        Year of joining        Address
Robert        1994            64C- WallsStreat
Sam           2000            68D- WallsStreat
John          1999            26B- WallsStreat

use setters getters of all variables and print() function to print the details of an employee.

Question 3:
Amanda and Tyler opened a business that specializes in shipping liquids, 
such as milk, juice, and water, in cylindrical containers. The shipping 
charges depend on the amount of the liquid in the container. (For simplicity, you may assume that the container is filled to the top.) They also provide 
the option to paint the outside of the container for a reasonable amount. 
Write a program that does the following:
a. Prompts the user to input the dimensions (in feet) of the container 
(radius of the base and the height).
b. Prompts the user to input the shipping cost per liter.
c. Prompts the user to input the paint cost per square foot. (Assume that the 
entire container including the top and bottom needs to be painted.)
d. Separately outputs the shipping cost and the cost of painting. Your program must use the class cylinderType (designed in Programming 
Exercise 3) to store the radius of the base and the height of the container. (Note that 1 cubic feet 5 28.32 liters or 1 liter 5 0.353146667 
cubic feet.)
